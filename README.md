Airbus Takeoff Performance Calculator



The Airbus Takeoff Performance Calculator is an Android application designed to calculate essential takeoff parameters for various Airbus aircraft. Users can input flight and environmental data, and the app will compute V1, VR, V2 speeds, trim, and FLEX temperature, providing key metrics for safe takeoff configuration.

Features


User Input: Allows input for takeoff parameters such as flaps configuration, gross weight, QNH, temperature, runway condition, anti-ice settings, and more.
Aircraft Performance Calculations: Computes V1, VR, V2 speeds, trim settings, and FLEX temperature based on the input data.
Customizable Aircraft Types: Supports different Airbus aircraft types with tailored performance calculations.
Real-time Results: Displays calculated results immediately after user input, ensuring quick access to critical flight data.
Project Structure
The application is structured using the MVVM design pattern, providing a clear separation between the UI and business logic. Key components include:

UI (Fragments): Collects user inputs and displays results.
Data Models: Represents input data, aircraft specifications, and calculation results.
Calculation Engine: Handles all computations related to takeoff performance.
Installation
